# metagpt-dh-keyexchange-python
Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange designed & coded by MetaGPT in Python

**Requirements**

Install MetaGPT using instructions from included README file or using README located at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT

Update OPENAI_API_KEY setting with a key generated from www.openai.com (signup required)

Run the Startup.py code in a Command window(a.k.a. 'terminal' in OSX) supplying a prompt for the software to be created e.g. "Write some python classes for diffie-hellman key usage between a client and server. The source of the keys for client & server could be stored in AWS Secrets or Azure Key Vault or Keeper Security. Write some tests for the python classes."

Review the generated code and documents to see how MetaGPT designed the solution and what the technical solution looks like in e.g. Mermaid (https://mermaid.js.org)
