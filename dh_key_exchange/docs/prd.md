## Original Requirements
The boss requires the creation of Python classes for the implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol between a client and a server. The keys for the client and server should be stored in secure storage services such as AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security. The Python libraries should utilize the azure.identity and Crypto.Random.random modules. Additionally, tests should be written for these Python classes to ensure their functionality and reliability.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create Python classes for the implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.",
    "Ensure secure storage of keys using AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security.",
    "Write tests for the Python classes to ensure their functionality and reliability."
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a server, I want to securely exchange keys with a client using the Diffie-Hellman protocol.",
    "As a client, I want to securely exchange keys with a server using the Diffie-Hellman protocol.",
    "As a user, I want to store my keys securely in AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security.",
    "As a developer, I want to ensure the functionality of the Python classes through tests.",
    "As a developer, I want to use the azure.identity and Crypto.Random.random modules in the Python libraries."
]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a set of Python classes implementing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. It should allow secure key exchange between a client and a server. The keys should be securely stored using AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security. The Python libraries should utilize the azure.identity and Crypto.Random.random modules. Tests should be written to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Python classes.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol in Python classes.", "P0"),
    ("Securely store keys using AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security.", "P0"),
    ("Utilize azure.identity and Crypto.Random.random modules in Python libraries.", "P0"),
    ("Write tests for the Python classes.", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the functionality and reliability of the Python classes.", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
As this is a backend functionality, there is no UI involved. The focus is on the functionality of the Python classes and the secure storage of keys.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points. The requirements are well-defined and straightforward.
