## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("diffie_hellman.py", "Contains the DiffieHellman class with methods generate_keys() and compute_shared_secret(other_public_key)"),
    ("secure_storage.py", "Contains the SecureStorage class and its subclasses AzureKeyVault, AWSSecrets, and KeeperSecurity with methods store_key(key, key_id) and retrieve_key(key_id)"),
    ("main.py", "Contains the main program flow, calling methods from DiffieHellman and SecureStorage classes"),
    ("tests.py", "Contains unit tests for all the classes and methods in the other files")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "diffie_hellman.py",
    "secure_storage.py",
    "main.py",
    "tests.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'diffie_hellman.py' contains the DiffieHellman class which implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. It has two methods: generate_keys() which generates a pair of private and public keys, and compute_shared_secret(other_public_key) which computes the shared secret using the other party's public key.

'secure_storage.py' contains the SecureStorage class and its subclasses AzureKeyVault, AWSSecrets, and KeeperSecurity. These classes are responsible for storing and retrieving keys from their respective secure storage services.

'main.py' is the main entry point of the program. It calls methods from the DiffieHellman and SecureStorage classes to implement the secure key exchange process.

'tests.py' contains unit tests for all the classes and methods in the other files. It uses the pytest and unittest libraries for testing.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, the choice of secure storage service (AWS Secrets, Azure Key Vault, or Keeper Security) should be made based on the specific needs and constraints of the project. Also, the main.py file should be implemented in a way that it can handle exceptions and errors properly.
